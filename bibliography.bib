	abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has placed an enormous burden on health systems, and guidelines have been developed to help healthcare practitioners when resource shortage imposes the choice on who to treat. However, little is known on the public perception of these guidelines and the underlying moral principles. Here, we assess on a sample of 1033 American citizens’ moral views and agreement with proposed guidelines. We find substantial heterogeneity in citizens’ moral principles, often not in line with the guidelines recommendations. As the guidelines are likely to directly affect a considerable number of citizens, our results call for policy interventions to inform people on the ethical rationale behind physicians or triage committees decisions to avoid resentment and feelings of unfairness.},

	url = {https://cran.uni-muenster.de/web/packages/ordinal/vignettes/clm_article.pdf},
	abstract = {This paper introduces the R-package ordinal for the analysis of ordinal data using cumulative link models. The model framework implemented in ordinal includes partial proportional odds, structured thresholds, scale eﬀects and ﬂexible link functions. The package also support cumulative link models with random eﬀects which are covered in a future paper. A speedy and reliable regularized Newton estimation scheme using analytical derivatives provides maximum likelihood estimation of the model class. The paper describes the implementation in the package as well as how to use the functionality in the package for analysis of ordinal data including topics on model identiﬁability and customized modelling. The package implements methods for proﬁle likelihood conﬁdence intervals, analysis of deviance tables with type I, II and III tests, predictions of various kinds as well as methods for checking the convergence of the ﬁtted models.},
